# tightknot -- Class wrapper around libknot.control

# Higher-level transaction management, collecting succes/failure.

import libknot.control

#
# This uses the Python library to control Knot DNS.
# Its document includes a decent example:

#     Example:
#         import json
#         from libknot.control import *
#     
#         #load_lib("/usr/lib/libknot.so")
#     
#         ctl = KnotCtl()
#         ctl.connect("/var/run/knot/knot.sock")
#     
#         try:
#             ctl.send_block(cmd="conf-begin")
#             resp = ctl.receive_block()
#     
#             ctl.send_block(cmd="conf-set", section="zone", item="domain", data="test")
#             resp = ctl.receive_block()
#     
#             ctl.send_block(cmd="conf-commit")
#             resp = ctl.receive_block()
#     
#             ctl.send_block(cmd="conf-read", section="zone", item="domain")
#             resp = ctl.receive_block()
#             print(json.dumps(resp, indent=4))

class TightKnot:

	"""This class maintains state about Knot transactions:

	   **txn_success** is a boolean that indicates that the
	   current transaction has been successful up to here.

	   **txn_conf** is a boolean indicating if a global
	   configuration transaction has been assigned.

	   **txn_zone** is a set of zones for which a transaction
	   has been opened.

	   GOOD: Can use zone=, owner=, ttl=(str), rtype=, data=
	   GOOD: Could wrap and test if a zone is already locked
	   POOR: Cannot lock zones inside conf.
	   GOOD: Succeeded blocks usually have an inverse.
	   POOR: Need to build trasactions on top of Knot's...
	   POOR: Have to use '@' in owner names, at least for SOA.
	   POOR: Only one control connection at any time.
	   POOR: Maximum timeout does not cause error.
	   GOOD: Maximum timeout can be requested.
	   POOR: May need to keepalive a transaction.
	   POOR: Commit does not always finish a transaction.
	   POOR: Cannot wait for a transaction lock.
